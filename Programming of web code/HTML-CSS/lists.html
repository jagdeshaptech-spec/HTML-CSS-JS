            A mobile phone, often called a cell phone or smartphone, is designed to provide communication on the go. Modern mobiles are equipped with numerous features beyond just voice calling, including internet access, cameras, GPS navigation, apps for social media, games, productivity, and much more.

        <dd>A laptop is a lightweight, compact computer that you can easily carry and use anywhere. It combines all the essential components of a desktop computer—such as the processor, memory, storage, display, and keyboard—into one foldable unit. Laptops run on battery power, allowing you to work, browse the internet, play games, or perform other computing tasks without needing to be plugged into an electrical outlet constantly. They are widely used for work, education, entertainment, and personal projects, offering the flexibility to work remotely or on the move.</dd>
